"Congress, Paralyzed on a Stimulus Deal, Gives Itself Another Week to Strike One","

WASHINGTON — After months of fruitless haggling and a frenzied few days of revived talks, Congress missed yet another deadline on Friday to deliver an economic stimulus package to help struggling Americans weather the pandemic, instead agreeing to extend government funding for an additional week as leaders continued to search for a deal.The Senate approved a one-week stopgap bill to keep federal spending flowing until next Friday, securing additional time for negotiators to hammer out both a catchall spending package and an elusive coronavirus aid compromise that has divided them since summertime. Leaders have said they planned to merge the two packages should agreement be reached.While President Trump signed the temporary funding bill and kept the government from shutting down, it remained unclear whether seven days would be enough for lawmakers to complete the dozen must-pass annual spending bills and break through their impasse over providing relief to millions of Americans, small businesses and schools and funding efforts to distribute a vaccine.Time is waning for lawmakers to resolve policy divisions, with a number of government programs and policies that are helping insulate millions of Americans from the economic consequences of the pandemic set to expire in the coming weeks. An estimated 12 million workers could lose jobless benefits when two federal programs that expand and extend the unemployment insurance system expire this month, and a federal moratorium on evictions lapses on Dec. 31 without administrative action.

Support for the stopgap measure, which overwhelmingly passed the House on Wednesday, was widespread enough in the Senate that it ultimately passed by voice vote. But the private wrangling before the vote on Friday forecast how difficult it will be for lawmakers to strike an agreement on the first infusion of pandemic relief since April and the broader funding package.An unlikely bipartisan pair, Senators Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, warned that they planned to try to force a vote on legislation that would send another round of $1,200 checks to Americans if that provision was left out of a deal, with Mr. Hawley promising “an interesting week” ahead in the Senate.“If I have anything to say about it — and I guess I do — we’re not going to go home for the Christmas holidays unless we make sure that we provide for the millions of families in this country who are suffering,” Mr. Sanders said on the Senate floor.Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, had also resisted voting on the stopgap bill without the promise of a vote on a measure to end the threat of government shutdowns, and it was unclear if he and other conservative allies would try another blockade.Lawmakers and aides planned to work through the weekend to haggle over a stimulus plan and the broader spending package. Signaling that the negotiations could bleed into the holidays, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California noted on Thursday that Congress had previously worked through Christmas in the absence of an agreement.

An omnibus package may include legislation that would end the practice of “surprise medical billing,” which is when a patient is unexpectedly treated by a doctor who does not take their insurance, after top lawmakers reached a bipartisan, bicameral agreement.The current proposal would protect patients from surprise bills, and would require insurers and medical providers who cannot agree on a payment rate to use an outside arbitrator, who would determine a payment amount based partly on what other doctors and hospitals are typically paid for similar services.Ms. Pelosi said in a statement Friday night that the House planned to push for the legislation to be included in a final spending package.But on the matter of providing additional pandemic relief, the two policy divides that have long impaired a deal — Republicans’ insistence on sweeping coronavirus liability protections and Democrats’ demands to provide an infusion of federal funds of states and cities facing fiscal crises — remain sticking points.Democrats and some Republicans have argued that providing another round of relief for cash-short state and local governments is critical to avoid laying off city workers. But many Republicans have derided the proposal as a so-called blue-state bailout that could be used to close pre-existing budget shortfalls that were a result of mismanagement, not the economic fallout from the pandemic. Democrats have likewise warned that a sweeping liability shield prioritized by Republicans is a nonstarter, arguing that there has not been a surge in lawsuits related to the pandemic, and offering blanket protections against such suits would serve only to weaken worker protections.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has suggested jettisoning both provisions to get a swift agreement on a narrower package that would include funding vaccine distribution and the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular loan program for small businesses. But some lawmakers are reluctant to resort to that, citing the urgency of addressing the toll of the pandemic.“These problems don’t go away,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is part of the group that is working on a bipartisan $908 billion compromise framework. “If anything, they just get bigger. So if we can just stick to it, get a proposal that we can advance that resolves not only goals like unemployment, P.P.P., food security, but also the state and local and tribal and the liability issue — this is what we’ve been working on. This is what we need to keep doing.”

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. again signaled his support for a smaller relief package on Friday, saying at an event in Wilmington, Del., that “this relief package won’t be the total answer even if it gets passed, but it’s an important first step.”But the $908 billion framework that moderate lawmakers have labored over remains unfinished even after days of private meetings and negotiations. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, told reporters that “it is proving to be extremely difficult to close” the gap on liability protections.Should a final agreement and legislative text emerge, it is expected to include some form of limited legal protection for coronavirus-related lawsuits, $160 billion in state and local funding, billions of dollars for schools, businesses and vaccine distribution, and $300-a-week supplemental federal jobless payments until the spring.The proposal, for now, does not include direct payments in the form of stimulus checks. But Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican, suggested that in exchange for removing funding for state and local governments, a compromise plan could include another round of direct payments.“You wouldn’t be able to get as much as they’re talking about, but it would still be a pretty significant direct payment to people out there,” Mr. Thune said as he left the Capitol. “I think there’s a whole range of things that both sides agree on, and we ought to do today what we can agree on, and leave the other issues for another day.”Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York, and Thomas Kaplan and Margot Sanger-Katz from Washington.",Emily Cochrane,"Dec. 11, 2020",2020-12-17 02:19:52.195422
"Staring Down Deadline, Congress Nears $900 Billion Stimulus Deal","

WASHINGTON — After months of stalemate, congressional leaders were on the verge on Wednesday of cementing a roughly $900 billion stimulus deal to deliver emergency aid to individuals and companies devastated by the toll of the worsening pandemic, racing to finish the details and stave off a government shutdown on Friday.The measure, which has been under discussion for months as the coronavirus has ravaged the economy, is expected to provide a new round of direct payments to millions of Americans as well as additional unemployment benefits, food assistance and rental aid. It would prop up sputtering businesses with federally backed loans and provide funding for schools, hospitals and the distribution of a just-approved vaccine.While the agreement was not yet final, Republicans and Democrats alike signaled that they were ready to coalesce around the main elements, marking an extraordinary shift from just weeks ago, when both sides were issuing ultimatums and refusing to budge from long-held positions.It was unclear when a final agreement would be reached, as lawmakers and staff haggled over what Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, referred to as “just the fine details we’ve got to get done.”

“We’ll be ready when we’re ready,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told reporters. “A lot of writing goes into it and the rest.”The momentum on Wednesday, however, indicated that relief could soon be on its way for individuals and businesses who have waited for months as economists have clamored for another robust infusion of federal aid, warning that Congress’s failure to act could do long-lasting damage.“We’re making good progress,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, in a brief interview on Wednesday afternoon as staff exchanged offers and counteroffers. “No one gets everything they want, but we’re feeling pretty good.”But even as lawmakers moved toward striking an elusive deal, the package pointed to troubles on the horizon for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had pressed for at least some compromise on emergency pandemic aid before year’s end. To break the logjam, Democrats appeared to have dropped their demand for a dedicated funding stream for states and cities that are facing fiscal ruin, guaranteeing that Mr. Biden will have to act early in his tenure to try to bolster them and take additional action to prop up the economy.“The stimulus package is encouraging,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday at an event in Wilmington, Del. “But it’s a down payment — an important down payment on what’s going to have to be done beginning the end of January into February. But it’s very important to get done.”

For months, Democrats and Republicans had been unwilling to compromise amid a toxic presidential election. Democrats, who initially pushed a $3.4 trillion plan, held out for a much broader package than Republicans were willing to consider in the run-up to the November election, judging that President Trump and his party would pay a political price for failing to agree to a generous new batch of aid.Republicans, for their part, were wary of any new federal spending and insisted on a much narrower plan that would extend sweeping coronavirus liability protections. They appeared to have put that demand aside in recent days in exchange for Democrats backing off their insistence on a large new infusion of state and local assistance. (Two officials familiar with the talks said there were other avenues to potentially provide the aid.)But the political calculus changed after the election. Mr. Biden and his advisers began quietly pressing for Democrats to strike a deal — even a scaled-down one — and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had powerful reasons of his own to compromise. On Wednesday, he suggested on a private call with Republicans that delivering the stimulus package could bolster the party’s hopes of hanging onto its majority in the Senate, according to three people who relayed his comments on the condition of anonymity.Mr. McConnell said that Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who are both facing runoffs in January that will determine which party controls the Senate, were “getting hammered” for Congress’s failure to deliver more pandemic aid to struggling Americans — particularly the direct payments — and that enacting the measure could help them. The majority leader also emphasized that the package could be signed by Mr. Trump, who has pushed for another round of stimulus checks.The Coronavirus Outbreak ›Latest UpdatesUpdated Dec. 16, 2020, 7:32 p.m. ETA happy surprise as vaccine vials turn out to hold more than thought.Chris Christie, reflecting on his own coronavirus experience, releases a video urging people to wear masks.How good is that mask you’re wearing? You may soon find out.Even as enthusiasm built that the long-stalled stimulus talks were finally bearing fruit, it was clear that the potential agreement was far smaller than what economists say is needed.The plan under discussion amounts to less than half of the $2.2 trillion stimulus law enacted in March, and it does not come close to matching what many economists had said would be necessary to jolt the economy out of a pandemic-induced slump. They have warned for months about permanent economic damage and deteriorating prospects for a swift recovery, offering a grim backdrop as lawmakers traded blame.Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, reiterated his call for more fiscal stimulus on Wednesday, saying that the continuing rise in Covid-19 cases and the lapse in funding for several programs that were helping households and businesses stay afloat posed challenges for the economy.

“The case for fiscal policy right now is very, very strong, and I think that’s widely understood right now,” he said. “Now that we can kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, it would be bad to see people losing their business, their life’s work, even generations’ worth of work.”Even as negotiations continued, there was evidence of economic harm the worsening pandemic was causing. Retail sales fell 1.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported, with restaurants and bars experiencing even bigger declines as states reimposed business restrictions.Other measures of economic activity have likewise slowed in recent weeks, and applications for unemployment benefits have surged. For the millions of Americans already relying on jobless benefits, the situation could be even more dire if two programs that expand and extend the unemployment insurance system expire after next week without congressional action.Republicans have continued to insist that a package should remain under $1 trillion in order to maintain support within their ranks, leaving lawmakers and staff to wrangle over funding levels for various provisions and programs in the new measure. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer spoke with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for about 45 minutes on Wednesday as they worked to hammer out final details.The measure, which builds off a $748 billion bill proposed by a bipartisan group of moderates this week, is expected to include $25 billion to establish a program that would provide emergency rental assistance to families affected by the pandemic, as well as billions for vaccine development and distribution, broadband and schools across the country.Negotiators were still discussing the possible inclusion of House legislation that provides funds to distribute to states and cities and to fully cover the costs of emergency work during the pandemic. They were also still haggling over an expansion and extension of unemployment benefits and how long they would last. The agreement is expected to revive lapsed enhanced unemployment benefits at about $300 a week, half of the original benefit approved in March, which lapsed over the summer. But Republicans were insisting on curtailing the number of weeks of benefits to help offset the cost of providing stimulus payments.In addition to the jobless aid, the plan would provide a one-time direct payment to Americans, expected to be about $600 per person, also half the amount provided under the March stimulus law.

Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who has been vocal about his belief that Democrats succumbed too easily to Republican demands, and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a leader of the bipartisan group, got into a heated exchange on a private Democratic caucus call over progressives’ push to increase the amount of the direct payments, according to three people familiar with the discussion.“It will be a progressive holding their nose and voting for something because we don’t want to take away $600 from American families before Christmas and we don’t want to take unemployment benefits away from people,” said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California.The measure is likely to advance as part of a catchall spending package that will include the dozen annual bills needed to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year. Among the unresolved issues was whether to include a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on legislation that would end the practice of surprise medical billing.“I’m cautiously optimistic that maybe we will be able to finish up by the end of this week,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and one of the key lawmakers involved in drafting the bipartisan proposal.But Mr. McConnell warned Republicans in the private conference call to prepare to remain in Washington through the weekend as lawmakers and aides finish the details and write legislative text.Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Fandos and Ben Casselman from New York, and Catie Edmondson, Thomas Kaplan and Jeanna Smialek from Washington.",Emily Cochrane,"Dec. 16, 2020",2020-12-17 02:19:55.184014
Vaccination Campaign at Nursing Homes Faces Obstacles and Confusion,"

In coming days, squads of CVS and Walgreens employees, clad in protective gear and carrying small coolers, will begin to arrive at tens of thousands of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities to vaccinate staff and residents against the coronavirus.It promises to be a crucial milestone in America’s battle against a pandemic that has inflicted especially severe carnage on nursing homes. At least 106,000 residents and staff of long-term care facilities have died from the virus, accounting for 38 percent of the country’s Covid-related fatalities.But even before it begins, the mass-vaccination campaign is facing serious obstacles that are worrying nursing home executives, industry watchdogs, elder-care lawyers and medical experts. They expect nursing homes to be the most challenging front in the mission to vaccinate Americans.

Some residents and staff are balking at taking the vaccine. Short-staffed facilities are concerned about workers calling in sick with side effects, straining resources just as some frail residents are likely to experience fever and fatigue from the shot. Most nursing home employees work in shifts; will it be possible to vaccinate everyone over the course of just a few visits from CVS and Walgreens?

While some states began vaccinations in nursing homes this week, the broader nationwide effort will start over the next few days. And there remains widespread confusion about a key element: how nursing homes will get consent to vaccinate residents who aren’t able to make their own medical decisions. A CVS executive said such residents’ legal representatives will be able to provide consent to nursing homes electronically or over the phone, but officials at multiple large nursing home chains said they weren’t aware of that.If residents or their representatives haven’t given consent before CVS or Walgreens employees show up, it is not clear whether or when they will have another chance to be inoculated.“Given the pace of this rollout, I am very concerned that nursing facilities won’t have the time or capacity to really explain the vaccine to residents and their families,” said Nicole Howell, a state-funded ombudsman in California whose office works with 29,000 long-term care residents.

Pharmacists from Walgreens are scheduled to arrive next week at the 460-bed Gurwin Jewish Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Commack, N.Y., to begin vaccinations. Employees, residents and their families have been peppering Stuart Almer, the home’s chief executive, with questions. Can residents and staff orally agree to receive the vaccine or will they have to sign something? What role, if any, will nursing home employees play in vaccinating residents?Mr. Almer said he has spent hours on the phone with federal and state agencies but has few answers.“We still don’t know very much,” he said.Executives from CVS and Walgreens said in interviews that they have been planning the vaccination campaign for months and are confident it will work. “If there are concerns or challenges, we certainly are open to work with facilities to try to minimize any disruption that they may have,” said Rick Gates, a Walgreens executive leading the company’s planning.

Dr. David Gifford, chief medical officer for the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, which represents nursing homes and similar facilities, said most long-term care providers seem to be getting the information they need about the vaccination effort.Still, he said, “this is a rapidly changing situation, and constant, clear communication from everyone is critical to make sure this program runs smoothly.”The federal government has agreements with CVS and Walgreens to send pharmacists and support staff to vaccinate residents and staff at thousands of long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and assisted-living communities.

More than 40,000 facilities have opted to work with CVS. Nearly 35,000 chose Walgreens. It is up to each state to pick whether to have the pharmacies use vaccines made by Pfizer or Moderna (whose vaccine the Food and Drug Administration plans to authorize on Friday) at all its long-term care facilities.ImageThe handheld cooler bags that CVS employees will use to bring vaccine doses from pharmacies to nursing homes.Credit...CVSSome states are starting vaccinations in their nursing homes this week, but the campaign led by CVS and Walgreens won’t begin in earnest until Monday. In some states, it won’t begin until the end of the month or January.Because of the large number of facilities they must visit, CVS and Walgreens only have the capacity to go to each location two or three times. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both require two doses, separated by a few weeks, which means that at most nursing homes, all staff and residents will have to receive their shots on the same days.Chris Cox, the CVS executive in charge of planning the vaccine effort, said that if the company hears from nursing homes worried that three visits won’t be enough, it will deal with those concerns “on a case-by-case basis.”Covid-19 Vaccines ›Answers to Your Vaccine QuestionsWith distribution of a coronavirus vaccine beginning in the U.S., here are answers to some questions you may be wondering about:If I live in the U.S., when can I get the vaccine? While the exact order of vaccine recipients may vary by state, most will likely put medical workers and residents of long-term care facilities first. If you want to understand how this decision is getting made, this article will help.When can I return to normal life after being vaccinated? Life will return to normal only when society as a whole gains enough protection against the coronavirus. Once countries authorize a vaccine, they’ll only be able to vaccinate a few percent of their citizens at most in the first couple months. The unvaccinated majority will still remain vulnerable to getting infected. A growing number of coronavirus vaccines are showing robust protection against becoming sick. But it’s also possible for people to spread the virus without even knowing they’re infected because they experience only mild symptoms or none at all. Scientists don’t yet know if the vaccines also block the transmission of the coronavirus. So for the time being, even vaccinated people will need to wear masks, avoid indoor crowds, and so on. Once enough people get vaccinated, it will become very difficult for the coronavirus to find vulnerable people to infect. Depending on how quickly we as a society achieve that goal, life might start approaching something like normal by the fall 2021.If I’ve been vaccinated, do I still need to wear a mask? Yes, but not forever. Here’s why. The coronavirus vaccines are injected deep into the muscles and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. This appears to be enough protection to keep the vaccinated person from getting ill. But what’s not clear is whether it’s possible for the virus to bloom in the nose — and be sneezed or breathed out to infect others — even as antibodies elsewhere in the body have mobilized to prevent the vaccinated person from getting sick. The vaccine clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated people are protected from illness — not to find out whether they could still spread the coronavirus. Based on studies of flu vaccine and even patients infected with Covid-19, researchers have reason to be hopeful that vaccinated people won’t spread the virus, but more research is needed. In the meantime, everyone — even vaccinated people — will need to think of themselves as possible silent spreaders and keep wearing a mask. Read more here.Will it hurt? What are the side effects? The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is delivered as a shot in the arm, like other typical vaccines. The injection into your arm won’t feel different than any other vaccine, but the rate of short-lived side effects does appear higher than a flu shot. Tens of thousands of people have already received the vaccines, and none of them have reported any serious health problems. The side effects, which can resemble the symptoms of Covid-19, last about a day and appear more likely after the second dose. Early reports from vaccine trials suggest some people might need to take a day off from work because they feel lousy after receiving the second dose. In the Pfizer study, about half developed fatigue. Other side effects occurred in at least 25 to 33 percent of patients, sometimes more, including headaches, chills and muscle pain. While these experiences aren’t pleasant, they are a good sign that your own immune system is mounting a potent response to the vaccine that will provide long-lasting immunity.Will mRNA vaccines change my genes? No. The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer use a genetic molecule to prime the immune system. That molecule, known as mRNA, is eventually destroyed by the body. The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which can stimulate the immune system. At any moment, each of our cells may contain hundreds of thousands of mRNA molecules, which they produce in order to make proteins of their own. Once those proteins are made, our cells then shred the mRNA with special enzymes. The mRNA molecules our cells make can only survive a matter of minutes. The mRNA in vaccines is engineered to withstand the cell's enzymes a bit longer, so that the cells can make extra virus proteins and prompt a stronger immune response. But the mRNA can only last for a few days at most before they are destroyed.Nursing homes are now diving into the mundane but crucial details about what will actually happen — and where — when the pharmacists show up with vaccines.At Genesis, the largest nursing chain in the United States, teams from CVS will vaccinate workers in common areas, while residents will be vaccinated in their own rooms.

“We don’t like to bring residents together into large groups because that can worsen any potential outbreak,” said Dr. Richard Feifer, the chain’s chief medical officer.Complicating the task, some nursing-home employees are reluctant to get inoculated, even though Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines have been found safe and effective during trials involving tens of thousands of people.

“I don’t want to be a guinea pig,” said Sheena Bumpas, a certified nursing assistant at a home in Duncan, Okla.She is far from alone. When the National Association of Health Care Assistants, an advocacy group for caregivers, recently surveyed certified nursing assistants who work in long-term care facilities, nearly 72 percent of respondents said they do not want to receive the vaccine.Lori Porter, the group’s co-founder and chief executive, said employees are also worried about what happens if they experience side effects — some participants in clinical trials experienced mild to moderate side effects — that force them to stay home. Ms. Porter said many nursing assistants had to use sick days to quarantine earlier in the pandemic and now have little or no paid sick leave left for 2020.Nursing home chains like Genesis have started campaigns to inform workers, residents and family members about the importance and safety of getting vaccinated.

“Written letters, emails, PowerPoint presentations, videoconferencing sessions, live face-to-face dialogue, small group, large group broadcasts — we’re doing it all,” Dr. Feifer said.But the more employees who get the vaccine, the more who are likely to experience side effects — and that could cause more problems.“If even as little as 10 percent of your staff calls off the next day — while at the same time all of the residents are irritated, upset and having adverse effects — you’ve created a perfect storm,” said Chad Worz, chief executive of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, which represents pharmacies that serve long-term care providers.

Among the biggest remaining challenges, however, is getting the informed consent of residents taking the vaccine.There is no federal requirement for people to give consent before getting vaccinated, but it is standard practice and is often needed for billing purposes. States have different requirements about how medical consent can be given and what information needs to be provided to the person who is consenting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance is that residents or their representatives should receive a fact sheet about the coronavirus vaccine and then consent to receiving it.The task of getting consent is not always straightforward at nursing homes. Many residents, like those with dementia, aren’t capable of giving it on their own. Instead, nursing homes need to get the permission of their family members or other legal representatives.

CVS and Walgreens have created paper and digital consent forms that nursing homes can use. Consent must be given in advance; the pharmacies need to know how many doses of the vaccine, which must be kept very cold, to bring with them.There’s significant confusion among nursing homes about getting consent, especially when it involves representatives who aren’t physically at the nursing home and can’t come because of concerns about spreading the virus. Will an email suffice? What about consent over the phone? Or will consent forms have to be signed, either in hard copy or electronically?Mr. Cox, the CVS executive, said the company this week has provided nursing homes with additional guidance on how to get consent. He said he expects most facilities to simply have an employee get consent over the phone from a resident’s medical proxy and then enter it in the person’s medical record. A nursing home employee can then sign the consent form on the resident’s behalf, he said.Even getting over-the-phone or electronic consent in a matter of days could prove time-consuming.Employees at SavaSeniorCare, one of the country’s largest nursing-home chains, don’t think they can start getting consent from residents and staff until they get the forms from CVS. As of Monday, they hadn’t received them, said Annaliese Impink, a SavaSeniorCare executive who is coordinating the vaccine rollout. (T.J. Crawford, a CVS spokesman, said the last batches of paperwork should arrive at nursing homes by Wednesday.)In the meantime, Ms. Impink said, nursing home staff have been calling family members of residents who can’t make their own consent decisions to confirm contact information to quickly get in touch for approval of the vaccination.Cissy Sanders, whose 71-year-old mother has a neurodegenerative disease and lives in a nursing home in Austin, said she has felt pressure to make a quick decision about vaccinating her mother.The administrator of her mother’s nursing home sent her an email on Monday, she said, informing her that the vaccine process was moving swiftly and doses were likely to run out.

“I am not in any way an anti-vaxxer,” she said, “but an email like that is designed to hurry me up, and I want the time to get all the information I can.” Ms. Sanders said she is worried about how the vaccine might affect her mother. (The F.D.A. has said that the only adults who should not get Pfizer’s vaccine are those with histories of severe allergic reactions to ingredients in the vaccine.)Officials at some facilities said they are optimistic about most of their residents agreeing to be vaccinated. Sunrise Senior Living, which operates 275 senior living communities in the United States, last week surveyed its residents and their family members about their willingness to get a Covid-19 vaccine. About 80 percent of respondents said they are definitely willing.At Genesis, which has been building its own electronic system for getting consent from residents’ medical proxies, executives are cautiously hopeful about the start of vaccinations.“It will be challenging; it will be complicated; it may get messy at times. But we’ve got to start quickly and lead the way,” Dr. Feifer said. “We’re going first. That’s a privilege and a responsibility to make sure we get this right.”",Jessica Silver-Greenberg,"Dec. 16, 2020",2020-12-17 02:20:17.273359
